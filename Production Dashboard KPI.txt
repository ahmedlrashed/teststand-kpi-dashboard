CONTROL STATS
 - For each metric(test-step), get mean, max, min, +3sig, -3sig

YIELD RATES
 - First-pass yield
 - Total yield 
 - False Failure rate = total yield - first pass yield

FAILURE MODES
 - Pareto
 - Quality
 - Scrap Rate = count(distinct(never-pass) / count(distinct(pass))

MFG CAPACITY
 - Avg Test Time
 - Units Per Day (optimal)
 - Units Per Day (actual) :: process slop
 - Optimal Monthly Capacity = Optimal UPD * Mfg-Days
 - Actual Monthly Capacity = Actual UPD * Mfg-Days


What the KPIs measure:
Unutilized capacity is a measure of sales team performance.
False pass rate is a measure of manufacturing quality.
False failure rate is a measure of test quality.
Optimal UPH is a measure of test throughput 
Actual UPH is a measure of process throughput
